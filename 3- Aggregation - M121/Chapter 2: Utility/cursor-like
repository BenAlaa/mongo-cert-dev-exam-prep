skip limit count sort

$limit: <int>
$skip: <int>
$count: <name we want the count called>
$sort: {<field>: <int, the sort direction>, ...}

special to sort: 
- if it is the first stage, then it will take advantage of the indexes
- else it will perform an in memory sort which will consume alot of memory in large datasets
- sort operations in the aggregation pipeline are limited to 100MB of ram
- passing this option to aggregate function {allowDiskUse: true} is required in large datasets
    or the operation will be terminated on the server
