- performing geo queries in the pipeline
- must be the first stage in the pipeline
- requires that the collection has one and only one geo index
difference between geoNear and near:
    - $near can't be used in aggregations
    - $near can't work with sharded cluters
    - queries using $near can't use special indexes like $text

{
    $geoNear: {
        near:                  required   <the location to search near>
        distanceField:         required   <field to insert in returned documents to save distance> 
        spherical:             required   <to signal whether using a 2d sphere index>
        minDistance:           optional   <in meters>
        maxDistance:           optional   <in meters>
        query:                 optional   <allows querying source documents>
        includeLocs:           optional   <used to indetify which locations was used>
        limit:                 optional   <max number of docs returned>
        num:                   optional   <same as limit>
        distanceMultiplier:    optional   <the factor to multiply all distances to convert to any desired unit>
    }
