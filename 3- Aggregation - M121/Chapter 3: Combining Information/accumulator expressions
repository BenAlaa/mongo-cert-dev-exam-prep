accumlator expressions can be used in group and project
in group, they work on field in each document
in project they work on array fields within the document

1- $sum:
    - {$sum: <expression>}
    - each time a doc is categorized in the group, its sum is called
    - if in project, expression must resolve to array
    - if in group, expression must resolve to single value in each doc

2- $avg:    
    - {$avg: <expression>}
    - will be calculated for each doc that match
    - if in project, expression must resolve to array
    - if in group, expression must resolve to single value in each doc

3- $max:
    - {$max: <expression>}
    - if in project, expression must resolve to array
    - if in group, expression must resolve to single value in each doc

4- $min:
    - {$min: <expression>}
    - if in project, expression must resolve to array
    - if in group, expression must resolve to single value in each doc

5- $stdDevPop: 
    - {$stdDevPop: <expression>}
    - if in project, expression must resolve to array
    - if in group, expression must resolve to single value in each doc

5- $stdDevSamp: 
    - {$stdDevSamp: <expression>}
    - if in project, expression must resolve to array
    - if in group, expression must resolve to single value in each doc

6- $first:
    - { $first: <expression> }
    - Returns the value that results from applying an expression to the first document in a group of documents. 
    - Only meaningful when documents are in a defined order.

6- $mergeObjects:
    - {
        $mergeObjects: <expression>
    }
    - if in project or any stage other than (group, bucket, bucketAuto), expression must resolve to array of documents
    - if in group, bucket or bucketAuto, expression must resolve to single document
