$unwind: "$genres" ---> genres is array

creates new documents where genres is now each value in the array

{
    genres: ["horror", "action"]
}
----->>> becomes >>>>
{
    genres: "horror"
}
{
    genres: "action"
}
=== Why ===
if you try to group by array fields it won't work because it uses pure equality (point to the same array)

- can exceed memory size be careful, use allowDiskUse in large collections
