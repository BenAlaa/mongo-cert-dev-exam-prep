- _id is the key indicator to group by
- uses all accumlator expressions
ex: {
    $group: {
        _id: "$year",
        num_films_in_year: {
            $sum: 1
        }
    }
}
- _id : <expression> , must resolve to the same result in order for docs to match
if we want to group all docs, the specify _id to be null or ""

expressions will ignore docs with missing or invalid inputs to the expression 
if the data is missng or invalid in all docs, the expression will resolve to null
