- like left outer join in sql
- {
    $lookup: {
        from: <collection to join>, // can't be a sharded collection and must exist in the same db
        localField: <field from input documents>,
        foreignField: <field from the from documents>,
        let: {"var": "expression"}, // expression uses fields from the original collection
        pipline: [                // pipline to run on the from collection
            aggregation
        ],
        as: <output array field name>  // will override if exists
    }
}

local and foreign are matched on equality
