1- If match stage uses shard key
    - all the pipeline will be routed to that shard
    - the results will be returned to mongos

2- No match
    - some stages will be splitted on each shard
    - then the results will be merged together on a single shard
    - it normally happens on random shard unless ($out, $facet, $lookup, $graphLookup) are used
    - in those cased the primary shard will do the merging
