- Non materialized view ... computed every time 
- projection in aggregation framework ----> vertical slicing
- matching certain documents in the aggregation  ---> horizontal slicing

- usage:
    - db.createView("viewName", "src_collection", [...aggregation_pipline], collation)
    - db.getCollectionInfos() ---> gives info for all collectoins in the db
    - db.system.views.find().pretty()
    - all read operation and aggregation on collection can be done on a view
    - only computed if we operated on them
    - No write, index, rename, mapReduce, $text, geoNear
    - find operations with projection operators are not permitted
        - $, elemMatch, slice, meta
