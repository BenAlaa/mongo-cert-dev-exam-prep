phases:
	1- Describing workloads:
		- requirement document
		- Business domain analysis
		- production logs and stats if migrating existing db

	2- Indentifying relationships between entities:
		- pieces of info that can be grouped together (entity)
		- Indentifying the relationships between entities
		- decide either keeping as embedded doc or in a new collection

	3- applyin design patterns to address performance requirements


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simplicity:
	- limitied expectations
	- low resources requiremens cpu ram disk
	- fewer collections and embedding documents
	- less disk access

Performance:
	- need more resources
	- Sharding
	- fast read, writes
	- larger teams needed
	- must adhere to the phases of methodology
