Using pattern may lead to

- Duplication of data across documents
- Data staleness in some pieces of data
- Data integrity issues 
	- may have to write application code to ensure referential integrity


1- Duplications:
	- results from embedding info in documents for faster access
		- ex: embedding the customer address in the shipment info document so it can't 
				be changed after the order is shipped if user changed his address
	- represents challenges to insure correctness and consistency

2- Staleness:
	- Data is changing constantly that updating can cause performance issues
	- challenges in insuring data quality and reliability
	- can be addressed using batch update and change streams

3- Referential integrity:
	- linking info between docs and not supporting cascading deletes or foreign keys
	- challenges in data quality
	- solutions:
		- using change streams
		- embedding data in single doc
		- using multi-doc transactions
