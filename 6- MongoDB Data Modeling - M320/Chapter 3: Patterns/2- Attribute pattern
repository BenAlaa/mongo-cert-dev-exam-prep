- Having different types represented in the same collection
- ex a collection of products

steps:
	- the charactristics that are almost always present (common schema parts), 
			represented as fields in the document
	- may need a lot of indexes
	- for the special attributes :
		- for each field, create a key value pair inside a new array field
			ex:												----- BECOMES ---->
						{																						{
							manufacturer: "",														manufacturer: "",
							price: "",																	price: "",
							color: "",																	color: "",
																													special_specs: [
							"aa": "1",																		{k: "aa", v: "1"},
							"ab": "2",																		{k: "ab", v: "2"},
							"ac": "3 mAh",																{k: "ac", v: "3", u: "mAh"},
																													]
						}																						}
	- can also be used when:
		- lots of similar fields in the same document
		- want to search across many fields once
		- fields that present only in a small subset of docs
		- you can create index on the key and value pairs to optimize searching
		
	- pros:
		- easier to index
		- allow non-deterministic field names
		- ability to qualify the relationship of the original field and value
