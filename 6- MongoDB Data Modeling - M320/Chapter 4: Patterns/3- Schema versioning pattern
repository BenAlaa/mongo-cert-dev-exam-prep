updating relational db schema:
	- neet time to update the data
	- usually done by stopping the app
	- hard to revert if something goes wrong

problem

	- upgrading all docs can take too much time
	-don't want to update all docs

	- choose a strategy to migrate the docs

use cases
	- apps that use db deployed in production env and heavily used
	- lots of legacy data

pros
	- no downtime
	- control migration
	- less future technical debt

cons 
	- may need 2 indexes for the same field during migration
