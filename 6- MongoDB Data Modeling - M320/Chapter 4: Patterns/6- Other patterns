Approximation:
	- problem:
		- data is expensive to calculate
		o- percision is not an issue
	- solution
		- fewer writes with higher payload
	- use cases:
		- statistics
		- counters with percision tolerance
		- web page counters
	- pros :
		- less writes
		- less contention on docs
		- statistically valid numbers
	- cons:
		- not exact numbers
		- must be implemented in the app

Outliers pattern:
	- problem:
		- few docs would drive solution
	- solution:
		- implementation that works with the majority
		- add field that indetify the Outliers
		- outliers are handeled differently on app side
	- use cases:
		- social networks
		- popularity
	- pros:
		- optimized for most cases
