can be changed at runtime using:
- using config db
- inserting into settings collection:
  - db.settings.save({_id: "chunksize", value: <inMB> (ex: 2)})
- changes will be applied when importing or saving new data


shard key frequency affects the number of chunks:
Jumbo chunks are larger than the defined chunksize and can't be moved or split 
this results from poor choice of key
