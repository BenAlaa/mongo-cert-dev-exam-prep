- a series of stages that feen into one another to run a query

- for a single query, many plans can be proposed based on the indexes
- only one winning plan is used

How it works:
	- fresh query comes to the db for the first time
	- the service looks for all indexes on the collection
	- choose indexes viable for the query (candidate indexes)
	- the query optimizer uses candidate indexes to generate candidate plans
	- the quey planner is emperical query planner --> means all candidate plans will be tried over 
			a short period of time then choose which plan performs best
	- then mongodb caches the winning plan for that query shape
	- the plans will be removed from cache if
		- the server is restarted
		- index is rebuilt
		- index is created or dropped
		- if threshold is reached, that is amount of work done by the first portion of the query exceeds the 
				work done by the winning plan by a factor of 10
