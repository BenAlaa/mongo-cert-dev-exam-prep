- public test suite
- private testing environment

types of benchmarking:
	- low level benchmarking:
		- I/O
		- scheduler performance
		- memory allocation and transfer speed
		- db server performance
		- thread performance
		...
		tools used:
		- sysbench
	
	- db server benchmarking:
		- dataset load
		- writes per second
		- reads per second
		- balanced workloads
		- read/write ratio
		tools:
		- YCSB
		- TPC

	- distributed systems benchmarking:
		- linearization of reads and writes
		- serialization of requests
		- fault tolerance if node fails
		tools:
		- highbench
		- jepsen

benchmarking conditions:
	- POCDriver tool to test mongodb workloads
	- benchmarking anti-patterns:
		- database swap replace (turning tables in sql dbs to collections)
		- using mongo shell for write and reads requests
		- using mongoimport to test writes response
		- local laptop to run tests
		- using default mongodb parameters
