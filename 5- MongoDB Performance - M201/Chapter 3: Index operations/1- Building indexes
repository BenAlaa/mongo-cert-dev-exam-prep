- Hyprid index build new in 4.2

types of index builds:
	- foreground index build:
		- very performant
		- locks the entire db until the build is done
		- createIndex({a: 1}) prior to 4.2

	- background index build:
		- doesn't lock the db
		- less performant
		- it uses incremental approach to create the index
		- the index resulting is less efficient than the foreground index
		- createIndex({a: 1}, {background: true}) prior to 4.2

	- Hyprid:
		- the only option available since 4.2
		- no locks on the db
		- performant
