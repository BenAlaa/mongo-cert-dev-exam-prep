- solves the problem of slow queries

- collection scan: is going through all docs in the collection 1 by 1   O(n) linear
- the data structure used to store indexes ----> B-tree
- indexing overhead:
    - slow writes ---> the tree will be updated
    - slow updates and deletes ---> the tree will be adjusted if the indexed field changes
