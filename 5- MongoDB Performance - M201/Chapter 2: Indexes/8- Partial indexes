- index only a subset of the collection

- db.collection.creatIndex(
	{a: 1, b: 1},
	{partialFilterExpression: {c: {$gte: 5}}}
)
	the above will index docs with c >= 5

- can be used with multi-key indexes

- sparse index:  (only index if the fields exist)
	- db.collection.creatIndex(
		{a: 1},
		{sparse: true}
	)
	the above is equal to
	- db.collection.creatIndex(
		{a: 1},
		{partialFilterExpression: {a: {$exists: true}}}
	)

- to use the index, the filter query must contain the partialFilterExpression 

- partialFilterExpression can't be used along with sparse
- _id can't be partial indexed
- shard key index can't be partial index
