- each collection has a file.wt
- each index has a file.wt

- database catalog: _mdb_catalog.wt
	- database catalog contains info about collections and indexes that this mongod has.


Running mongod with these flags:
	- '--directoryperdb' ---> each db has its own directory
	- '--wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes': directory for indexes and directory for collections inside the db folder

** benefits of the previous structure:
	- increasing performance:
		- if multiple disks are available, then distributing these files across different 
			disks (using symbolic links) will increase IO parrallization.

- mongodb can store data in compressed format which will increase the performance of data presistence 
	but will require more cpu cycles

- writing data from memory to disk will be triggered by two methods:
	- user side: by specifying write concern that syncs operation with other instances like 
		{ writeConcern: { w: 3 } } which means at least one primary and 2 secondaries
	- periodical internal process that regulates how data will be flushed and synced (sync periods)

- journaling:
	- journal flushes are performed using group commits in compressed format.
	- all writes are atomic
	- { writeConcern: { j: true } } wont acknowledge a write unless it has been written in the journal
	- will have impact on performance as it will wait until data is written on disk
