- the simplest index that can be created

- features: 
	- one field
	- single value for indexed field
	- or range of values
	- can use dot notation to index fileds in subdocuments
	- finding several distict values with a single query

- db.people.find({"ssn": "720-38-5636"}).explain("executionStats") ---> to view extra info about the query

- db.people.createIndex({ ssn: 1 }) to create index on ssn field

- explainable object:
	- let exp = db.people.explain("executionStats")
	- then we can run our queries on the exp object
	- exp.find({"ssn": "720-38-5636"})

- if more than one fields are queried and one of them is indexed,
	indexed results will be returned then filtered by the other fields
