- specifies language specific rules for string comparison

{
	locale: string,   the ICU supported locale
	caseLevel: boolean,
	caseFirst: string,
	strength: int,
	numericOrder: boolean,
	alternate: string,
	maxVariable: string,
	backwards: boolean
}

- where to specify collation:
	- db.createCollection("name", {collation: {...}}) collection creation option
	- db.createIndex({}, {collation: {...}}) as an option to index creation
			to use the index, specify the index collation while querying using the next method
	- db.find().collation({...}) as a iterator method
	- db.aggregate([{}, {collation: {...}}]) as a stage 

- benifits of using collation:
	- correctness by matching certain locale
	- it has a marginal performance impact
	- allows the use of case-insensitive indexes by using strength: 1 which will ignore case and diacritics
