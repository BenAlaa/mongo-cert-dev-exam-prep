- two ways:
	- in memory
	- using index

- in memory:
	- all data will be stored in ram
	- then sorting algorithm is run
	- max memory usage in sorting is 32MB if exceeded then the server will abort the operation

- using indexes: 
	- docs are ordered while saved in index using the index field
	- the docs returned will be sorted by the index then no need for additional sorting
	- direction will be forward if the sorting order is the same as the index and backward if not (asc - desc)
