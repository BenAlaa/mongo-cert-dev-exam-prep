- index on two or more fields

- the main index is the first index then the subsequent indexes are indexing within that main index and so on
	- index {name: 1, age: 1}
	- {name: "a", age: "1"}, {name: "a", age: "2"}
	- {name: "b", age: "3"}, {name: "b", age: "8"}

- index prefixes:
	- index {a: 1, b: 1, c: 1}
	- prefixes:
		- {a: 1}
		- {a: 1, b: 1}
	- prefexis will use the index although it doesn't utilize the whole index the remaining will be ignored

- sorting in compound indexes:
	- sorting can utilize index if the filter fields combined with sort fields gives index prefix
		- find({a: "", b: ""}).sort({c: 1})  will work for index {a: 1, b: 1, c: 1}
	- using single prefix ---> both directions will utilize the index
	- else, won't use index unless all is in the same direction as the index or all are reversed
