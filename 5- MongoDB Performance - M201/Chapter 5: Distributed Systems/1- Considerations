- latency
- data is spread across different nodes
- read implications
- write implications

in replication:
	- offloading ventual consistency data to secondaries
	- specific work load to target indexes on secondaries like BI

in sharding:
	- shard nodes must be themselves replicasets
	- sharding is for horizontal scaling
	- you should reach vertical scaling limit before sharding
	- knowing how data grows and changes to determine a good shard key
	- latency between different cluster elements
	- putting mongos on the same server as the application server should reduce latency
	- routed queries are more performant than scatter gathered queries
	- sorting limit and skip is performed locally on each shard then merged on the primary shard


- In MongoDB 4.2, we can use any of the shards (or mongos) to do final sort, limit and skip steps. 
		For more details, you can refer to How mongos Handles Query Modifiers section in the documentation.
