use secondary with differing indexes for:
	- analytics
	- reporting delayed consistency data
	- text search

considerations: it should be
	- with priority=0
	- hidden node
	- delayed secondary
	- they should not be allowed to be primary as they may not have the indexes to handle application queries

Steps to create index on secondary only:
	1- shut down the server
	2- bring up the secondary in stand alone mode
	3- create the index
	4- bring up the replicaset again
