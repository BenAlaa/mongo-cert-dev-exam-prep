1- If match stage uses shard key
    - all the pipeline will be routed to that shard
    - the results will be returned to mongos

2- No match
    - some stages will be splitted on each shard
    - then the results will be merged together on a single shard
    - it normally happens on random shard unless ($out, $facet, $lookup, $graphLookup) are used
    - in those cased the primary shard will do the merging


optimizations
1- if a sort is followed by match, the query optimizer will move the match above to limit the docs sorted
2- if skip is followed by limit, the query optimizer will move the limit up and change the values of each stage 
    to result in correct data ----> {skip: 10, limit: 5} will be { limit: 15, skip: 10 }
3- some stages can be combined together ---> {limit: 5}, {limt: 10} ---> {limit: 15} or skip or match if possible
