- picking a good shard key
- chunk max size is 64MB
- we need to insure that the chunks are distributed evenly across shards
- high cardinality, low frequency, low rate of change for shard key
- compound keys have high cardinality and low frequency
- jumbo chunk is a chunk with the same lower and upper bound
- monotonically changing shard keys should be avoided unless they are used in 
		compound keys and shouldn't be the first field
		using them this way increases the cardinality

- ordered bulkwrites are less performant on sharded cluster
- unordered bulkwrites can utilize parallization in sharded cluster
