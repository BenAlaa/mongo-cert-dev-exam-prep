Realtime processing:
    - providing data to applications   
    - performance is important

Batch processing:
    - providing data for analytics
    - performance is less important
------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Index usage:
    - if in a certain stage the index can't be used, then it won't be used in the following stages
    - pass { explain: true } as option to view the steps of execution
    - operators that use index should be at the start of the pipline
    - match, sort, limit should be in front

2- Memory constraints:
    - 16MB doc size limit applies
        - use limit and project
    - 100MB Ram per stage
        - use indexes
        - allowDiskUse less performant
        - graphLookup doesn't support allowDiskUse as it doesn't support spilling to disk
