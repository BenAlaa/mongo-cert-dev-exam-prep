- very performant
- satisfied entirely by index
- 0 docs needs to be examined

- a covered query has:
	- all index fields are the only fields in the predicate
	- projection to return only fields from index fields and the fields must be stated explicitly
	- no fields in the query are equal to null (i.e. {"field" : null} or {"field" : {$eq : null}} ).

- no fetch stage is present in the query plan

- can't be used when:
	- indexed fields are arrays
	- indexed fields are embedded docs
	- if the index doesn't contain the shard key in sharded deployment
