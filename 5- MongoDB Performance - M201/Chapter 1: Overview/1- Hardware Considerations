MEMORY:
    - very important
    - mongodb engines are either very dependant on ram or has fully in memory execution
    - Aggregations 
    - Index traversing 
    - write operations (are first performed on ram allocated pages) 
    - query engine 
    - connections (1MB per connection) all rely on ram
CPU:
    - Storage engine
    - concurrency model (wired tiger has non locking concurrency control mechanism)
    - page compression
    - data calculation
    - aggergation framework operations
    - map reduce
IO:
    - Data presistence on disk 
    - the faster the disk, the faster the db operations
    - RAID architectures
    - RAID 10 is the best for mongodb
    - RAID 0, 5 or 6 musn't be used
    - using several disks benifits mongodb by distributing the IO loads
    - the faster the network, the better performance with client apps
    - distributed architecture in mongodb means it needs low latency connection between different 
        components to enhance performance
